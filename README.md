## What We Will Implement:
We will modify the event scheduling application to be distributed and fault tolerant.

The languages we are going to use are:
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

## Technologies Used:
- **MERN Stack**: MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js
- **Create React App**: For setting up the React application.
- **Node.js**: Version 20.17.0 LTS (Ensure the installed version of Node.js is compatible with this version.)
- **Material UI** and **Material UI X**: For UI components and styling.
- **Microsoft Azure** for cloud distribution
- **Kubernetes** for containerization

## How to Compile and Run:

To compile and run the application, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Code**: You can download the repository in two ways:
   - Clone the repository to your local machine by typing the following command in your terminal:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/CarlNord01/Distributed-Event-Scheduling-Application.git
     ```
   - Download the ZIP file for the application by clicking "Download ZIP" from the GitHub repository.

2. **Install Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/). Ensure the installed version of Node.js is compatible with version 20.17.0 LTS.

3. **Open Two Terminals**:
   - One for the backend:
     - Navigate to the backend directory of the application (typically `Event-Scheduling-Application/backend`) in your terminal.
     - Run the following commands:
       ```bash
       npm install
       npm start
       ```

   - One for the frontend:
     - Navigate to the frontend directory of the application (typically `Event-Scheduling-Application/event-app`) in another terminal.
     - Run the following commands:
       ```bash
       npm install
       npm start
       ```

4. **Access the Application**: Once both the backend and frontend are running, you can access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. If you are not redirected to the application automatically, enter the URL manually.
